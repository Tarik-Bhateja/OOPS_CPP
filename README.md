## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code. Data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

## Core Concepts

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can help prevent accidental interference and misuse. This is usually achieved using access specifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity by allowing the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level. Abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in C++.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the attributes and methods of another class. It allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. This enables new classes to acquire the properties and behaviors of existing classes.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types. Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
